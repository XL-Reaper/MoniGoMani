**WARNING: MoniGoManiHyperStrategy should always be HyperOpted unless you really know what you are doing when manually allocating weights!**   
**MoniGoManiHyperStrategy found in releases already has a decent hyperopt applied to it for BTC pairs!**   
**When changing anything in `config.json` please [re-optimize](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/blob/main/VERYQUICKSTART.md#how-to-optimize-monigomani)!**   

# Very Quick Start (With Docker)   
1) [Download](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/releases) the latest `MoniGoMani` release and unzip it somewhere. Or clone the `main` branch through git.
2) Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
3) Open and edit `MoniGoMani/user_data/config-private.json` & `MoniGoMani/user_data/config.json`   
([VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is open source and comes pre-installed with good color codes to make it easier to read `.json` or `.log` files, and many more too)   
    3.A. Follow [these 4 easy steps](https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token) to create your own Telegram bot and fetch it's api-token, fill `token` under `telegram` up in `config-private.json` with this. Make sure to start a conversation with your bot before continuing!   
    3.B. Say `/start` to `@userinfobot` on Telegram to get your Chat ID, fill `chat_id` under `telegram` up in `config-private.json` with this.   
    3.C. Generate a strong key/password for `jwt_secret_key` under `api_server` in `config-private.json`   
    3.D. Choose and fill in a `username` and strong `password` also under `api_server` in `config-private.json`   
4) Open a terminal window and navigate to where you put `MoniGoMani` and type on of the following:   
    - `docker-compose pull` to pull in any updates to the Image if there are any
    - `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the bot & view its log or   
    - `docker-compose up -d`  to build and start the bot in the background.   
    - `docker-compose stop` to stop the bot.   
5) When running the included compose file FreqUI is already included and can be accessed from localhost:8080, 
   login is possible using the `username` and `password` from step 3.D.

That's it you successfully set up Freqtrade, connected to Telegram, with FreqUI! Congratulations :partying_face:

# Very Quick Start (From Source Code)   
1) Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)   
2) Open a terminal window and navigate to where you want to put `Freqtrade`   
3) Type `git clone https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade.git` to clone the Freqtrade repo    
4) Type `git checkout remotes/origin/develop` to switch to the development branch (currently needed for [Auto-HyperOptable Strategies](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/pull/4596))   
5) Type `./setup.sh -i` to install freqtrade from scratch   
6) Type `source ./.env/bin/activate` to activate your virtual environment (Needs to be done every time you open the terminal)   
7) *(Type `./setup.sh -u` to update freqtrade with git pull)*   
8) *(Type `./setup.sh -r` to hard reset the branch)*   
9) [Download](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/releases) the latest `MoniGoMani` release and unzip it in the `Freqtrade` folder. Or clone the `main` branch through git & copy the files over.   
10) Follow step 3 from the *Very Quick Start (With Docker)* above   

That's it you successfully set up Freqtrade natively, you can now use `MoniGoManiHyperStrategy` for hyperopting/backtesting/dry/live-running! Congratulations :partying_face:   
Check the [Go-To Commands](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/blob/main/VERYQUICKSTART.md#go-to-commands) for how to use it.   

# How to Optimize MoniGoMani   
*(These are just my ideas/theories, if you have other ideas, please test them & report your results to [#moni-go-mani-testing](https://discord.gg/xFZ9bB6vEz) so we can learn and improve the workflow!)*   
   
0) When you change anything in your `config.json`, `config-private.json` (besides personal info etc) or in `MoniGoManiHyperStrategy` itself you should always re-hyperopt to find the new ideal weights for your setup. This should also be done when the market changes in it's long term direction!   
1) Do some Technical Analysis on how your stake currency has been behaving in the last months/weeks & pick a logical timeframe to do your hyperopt upon (The timeframe in the go-to commands for example resembles some bullish rise/correction cycles & I believe 2021 will be a bullish year thus I think it's a good timeframe to test upon).   
2) Disable HyperOpting for the 6 `buy/sell___trades_when_downwards/sideways/upwards` settings and override them manually with some logical thinking (Noticed HyperOpt often doesn't place these locically on it's own, sometimes creating a hodlr bot), instructions for how to do this are under [HyperOpt Setting Overrides](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/blob/main/VERYQUICKSTART.md#hyperopt-setting-overrides)   
3) HyperOpt MoniGoManiHyperStrategy for a 1st run with the command provided in the [Go-To Commands](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/blob/main/VERYQUICKSTART.md#go-to-commands) (Free to alter the command if you have a good idea that you want to test)   
4) Apply the HyperOpt results from your 1st run into the HyperOpt Results Copy/Paste Section of `MoniGoManiHyperStrategy.py` (Manually add the 6 `buy/sell___trades_when_downwards/sideways/upwards` settings that where overridden in step 2 since they will be excluded from HyperOpts results)
5) Further Disable HyperOpting for `buy/sell_downwards/sideways/upwards_trend_signal_weight` settings that scored lower then `10%` in the 1st HyperOpt run and override them manually to `0%` (Indication of weak signal / signal not working well during these trends with your current weight allocation setup. Also `10%` was just an idea, feel free to change this) instructions for how to do this are under [HyperOpt Setting Overrides](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/blob/main/VERYQUICKSTART.md#hyperopt-setting-overrides)   
6) HyperOpt MoniGoManiHyperStrategy for a 2nd run with the command provided in the [Go-To Commands](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/blob/main/VERYQUICKSTART.md#go-to-commands). This is needed since fully disabling the weak signals in step 4 altered the setup, thus "ideal" weights that take this into consideration will have to be re-calculated again with a 2nd hyperopt run.   
7) Copy/Paste your results into the `Total-Overall-Signal-Importance-Calculator.py` & run it's [Go-To Command](https://github.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/blob/main/VERYQUICKSTART.md#go-to-commands) but include `-fm` or `--fix-missing` at the end of your command. This is needed to make them whole again since overridden weighted buy/sell_params will be missing from your HyperOpt results. (This command will re-include them with 0 as their value & re-print the fixed copy/paste-able weighted buy/sell_params)   
8) Apply the weighted `buy/sell_params` that the calculator fixed & the other result values from the 2nd hyperopt run into the HyperOpt Results Copy/Paste Section of `MoniGoManiHyperStrategy.py` (Manually add the 6 `buy/sell___trades_when_downwards/sideways/upwards` settings that where overridden in step 2 since they will be excluded from HyperOpt & Calculator results)
9) Turn off all Override settings again & you are done :smile:      

# HyperOpt Setting Overrides
When the Parameters in the HyperOpt Space Parameters sections are altered as following examples then they can be used as overrides while hyperopting / backtesting / dry/live-running   
(only truly useful when hyperopting though!) Meaning you can use this to set individual buy_params/sell_params to a fixed value when hyperopting!   
*(MoniGoManiHyperStrategy v0.8.1 or above Required!)*   
   
**WARNING: Always double check that when doing a fresh hyperopt or doing a dry/live-run that all overrides are turned off!**   
**WARNING: Overridden buy/sell_params will be missing from the HyperOpt Results!**   

### Override Examples:
Override `buy___trades_when_sideways` to always be **False**:
```python
buy___trades_when_sideways = \
    CategoricalParameter([True, False], default=False, space='buy', optimize=False, load=False)
```
Override `sell_downwards_trend_macd_weight` to always be **0**:
```python
sell_downwards_trend_macd_weight = \
    IntParameter(0, 100, default=0, space='sell', optimize=False, load=False)
```
| Function Param | Meaning |
| --- |--- |
| default=X      | The value used when overriding |
| optimize=False | Exclude from hyperopting (Make static) |
| load=False     | Don't load from the HyperOpt Results Copy/Paste Section |  

## Total Overall Signal Importance Calculator

Paste the `buy_params` & `sell_params` results from your HyperOpt over in the `/user_data/Total-Overall-Signal-Importance-Calculator.py` file.   
Then execute: `python ./user_data/Total-Overall-Signal-Importance-Calculator.py -sc BTC` from your favorite terminal / CLI to calculate the overall importance of the signals being used.   
The higher the score of a signal the better! And now it will also export to a `importance.log` file in the same folder for easy sharing!   
Share these results in [#moni-go-mani-testing](https://discord.gg/xFZ9bB6vEz) so we can improve the signals!   
   
- Now you must fill in `-sc` or `--stake-currency` with the one you use in `config.json` as `stake_currency` since it really matters
- Optional fill in `-f` or `--file` to submit a custom file name for the log file to be exported
- Optional fill in `-nf` or `--no-file` if you don't want a log file to be exported   
- Optional fill in `-fm` or `--fix-missing` to re-include missing weighted buy/sell_params with 0 as their value & re-print them as copy/paste-able results. Also keeps the tool from crashing when there are missing weighted values (Mostly useful after a hyperopt with overridden values)
